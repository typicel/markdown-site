# What I'm Doing Now

## School
Unfortuantely school takes up a lot of my time, so it's the main thing I'm working on currently. The classes I'm currently taking this semseter are
- Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- Human Computer Interaction

## Markdown to HTML Parser
Something that I started working on while creating this site. I wanted to create my own program that would parse markdown into HTML tags. I got somewhat deep into it but realized that for this site I can get away with just using a library for it (thanks [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)).

## Abandoned Game
I started creating a game using Godot for an itch.io game jam back at the end of October. I got a few days into it, and even recorded some footage to use for a potential video. However I couldn't get some things to work, and school sort of took over my attention so I had to abandon it for now. If I ever get bored maybe I'll end up coming back to it.
