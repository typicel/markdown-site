# What I'm Doing Now

## University
I'm finishing up my final semester of university, so this is taking up a lot of my time. I'm also starting to apply for full time positions.

## Job Hunting
As stated previously, I am looking for full-time work in the software engineering field. 

## OpenGL Game Engine
I've been working with OpenGL and GLFW to create some sort of game in a custom game engine. I don't really have a concrete idea of what I want to build yet. Right now I have it integrated with Dear ImGui for UI and Box2D for physics. You can look at the repository for it [here](https://github.com/typicel/opengl-game)
