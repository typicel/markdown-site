# What I'm Doing Now

## Logo Design Work
I'm working on designing some sort of icon or logo that I can use for this site. Been working recently with Affinity Designer and trying to get used to it. If I ever come up with something good you should be able to see it on this site.

## Game Development
I'd like to get more into game development using Godot. I don't really have any ideas for a game at the moment but I'm going to mess around with the engine and see if anything sticks.

## Markdown to HTML Parser
Something that I started working on while creating this site. I wanted to create my own program that would parse markdown into HTML tags. I got somewhat deep into it but realized that for this site I can get away with just using a library for it (thanks [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)).

## Abandoned Game
I started creating a game using Godot for an itch.io game jam back at the end of October. I got a few days into it, and even recorded some footage to use for a potential video. However I couldn't get some things to work, and school sort of took over my attention so I had to abandon it for now. If I ever get bored maybe I'll end up coming back to it.
