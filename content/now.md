# What I'm Doing Now

## University
I'm finishing up my final year of university, so this is taking up a lot of my time, along with continuing my summer internship part time through the semester.

## Bluesky Desktop Client
I'm working on a desktop client for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) written in Rust. You can check out the progress [here](https://github.com/typicel/stratosphere). It is not production ready at all and is just a small side project (mostly to learn Rust).

## Fillbots Reanimation
I'm working on a re-animation of the [Fillbots minigame](https://youtu.be/NW_OawBiaD8) from Rhythm Heaven in Blender. I'm still in the beginning stages of modeling and figuring out the specific style I'm going for. Check out some progress photos below:
