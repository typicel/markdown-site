# What I'm Doing Now

## Job Hunting
I just graduated from university and am currently looking for an entry level software engineering job. If you happen to be looking for someone like me feel free to reach out :)


<!-- ## OpenGL Game Engine
I've been working with OpenGL and GLFW to create some sort of game in a custom game engine. I don't really have a concrete idea of what I want to build yet. Right now I have it integrated with Dear ImGui for UI and Box2D for physics. You can look at the repository for it [here](https://github.com/typicel/opengl-game) -->
