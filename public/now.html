<h2 id="logodesignwork">Logo Design Work</h2>
<p>I'm working on designing some sort of icon or logo that I can use for this site. Been working recently with Affinity Designer and trying to get used to it. If I ever come up with something good you should be able to see it on this site.</p>
<h2 id="gamedevelopment">Game Development</h2>
<p>I'd like to get more into game development using Godot. I don't really have any ideas for a game at the moment but I'm going to mess around with the engine and see if anything sticks.</p>
<h2 id="markdowntohtmlparser">Markdown to HTML Parser</h2>
<p>Something that I started working on while creating this site. I wanted to create my own program that would parse markdown into HTML tags. I got somewhat deep into it but realized that for this site I can get away with just using a library for it (thanks <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">Showdown</a>).</p>
<h2 id="abandonedgame">Abandoned Game</h2>
<p>I started creating a game using Godot for an itch.io game jam back at the end of October. I got a few days into it, and even recorded some footage to use for a potential video. However I couldn't get some things to work, and school sort of took over my attention so I had to abandon it for now. If I ever get bored maybe I'll end up coming back to it.</p>
