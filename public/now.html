<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>Unfortuantely school takes up a lot of my time, so it's the main thing I'm working on currently. The classes I'm currently taking this semseter are</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdowntohtmlparser">Markdown to HTML Parser</h2>
<p>Something that I started working on while creating this site. I wanted to create my own program that would parse markdown into HTML tags. I got somewhat deep into it but realized that for this site I can get away with just using a library for it (thanks <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">Showdown</a>).</p>
<h2 id="abandonedgame">Abandoned Game</h2>
<p>I started creating a game using Godot for an itch.io game jam back at the end of October. I got a few days into it, and even recorded some footage to use for a potential video. However I couldn't get some things to work, and school sort of took over my attention so I had to abandon it for now. If I ever get bored maybe I'll end up coming back to it.</p>
