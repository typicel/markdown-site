<h2 id="jobhunting">Job Hunting</h2>
<p>I am currently open to full-time work as a software engineer. I am particularly focused on iOS development, but I am open to all other opportunities as well. If you are interested in hiring me, you can contact me at <code>mail @ this domain</code> and I can send you my resume. Thank you!</p>
<h2 id="loopover">Loopover</h2>
<p>Loopover is a 2D puzzle game for iOS devices. You can view more about it on my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page. Current development is focusing on a statistics page that lets you view averages for recent solves for time and number of moves. I am also looking into support for GameKit leaderboards and achievements. I would also like to add animations for moves to make the game feel a bit more fluid and responsive.</p>
<h2 id="lexel">Lexel</h2>
<p>Lexel is a spaced-repetition based language learning app that lets you learn by reading what you care about. It is currently in progress. Current development is focused on implementing spaced-repetition for vocabulary words, and working on improving performance.</p>
<!-- ## OpenGL Game Engine
I've been working with OpenGL and GLFW to create some sort of game in a custom game engine. I don't really have a concrete idea of what I want to build yet. Right now I have it integrated with Dear ImGui for UI and Box2D for physics. You can look at the repository for it [here](https://github.com/typicel/opengl-game) -->
